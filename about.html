            <p class="title">Meet the Artist</p>
            <p>   Melissa Bryant is an aspiring watercolor artist who was born and raised in North Idaho. She graduated from North Idaho College with an Associate of Arts degree in May 2022.
</p>
            <p>Melissa has been drawing and painting for as long as she can remember, which has bred in her a love for making art. To her, art is a meaningful method of communicating what is beautiful and worth sharing. Watercolor has been her go-to medium for a while as she is more familiar with it, and enjoys using it. She takes inspiration for her art from her experiences with her family, her religion, music, and nature. Her art is a vessel for her to bring her love for its subjects into the lives of others, and one of the ways that she would like to do that is through children's book illustrations; she would love the opportunity to bring the words of a story to life through her art.
